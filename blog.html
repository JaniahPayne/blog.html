<h2>HUMAN NEEDS NOT APPLY</h2>
<p>The video Human needs Not apply explains how robots are going to eventually take over humans jobs because they know better accuracy of different types of things and the robots are meant to make way less mistakes than any human.  The fear is that robots will take the new generations ideas and their will be no use for a human in the job place at all.

<h2>BlOWN TO BITS</h2>
<p>
In the book Blown To Bits I read about Footprints and Fingerprints.The book is basically saying that you leave fingerprints and footprints everywhere you go because your always touching things.Since now our world is full of technology we also leave electronic fingerprints and footprints by just connecting your fingerprint on your phone. Leaving small smudges of electronic fingerprints and footprints can be useful to someone who wants to consume this persons identity or figure out someones information.
